## Introduction

This project was designed as a way for you to practice and learn about Object Oriented Programming. A good bit of code has already been provided for you, and it makes for an _almost_ working game.

The project is divided in two parts. In a first part, you will fix and implement some basic functionality. In the second part, you will be able to customize the game as you wish!

Because there is a fair bit of JavaScript in this app, we have split code into more manageable pieces. You wil find all of the code in the `js` folder.

\_Because we split the code into many files, we need to import each file, in the right order in the `index.html` file.

## The game

This game is called **I CAN HAZ CHEEZBURGER?!??**. In the game, you play as an anthropomorphic cheeseburger. The only thing you can do is move left or right with the arrows of your keyboard.

The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding the Nyan Cats who are raining from the sky and trying to _haz_ you. The longer you stay alive, the higher your score!

At the moment, the game is a bit broken. This project will have you first fix the broken game, then add your own features to it. :)

## Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser, and observe what goes on when you load it.
2. After reading the instructions of the project, **take a look at the provided code**. Don't worry if you don't understand _everything_, but try to get a general feel for what the code is doing. There are _extensive_ comments throughout the code.
3. Once the provided code has been consulted,go through the Assignment section at your own pace.

## Assignment

### 1. Let's make the game actually end

If a Nyan Cat gets to you and eats you, the game keeps going on. Let's fix this!

First, look at the `gameLoop` method of the `Engine`. There's a part of the function that calls `this.isPlayerDead()` to verify if the player has died based on the current situation.

Next, look at the `isPlayerDead` method of the `Engine`. Notice that it's always returning `false`, which means that the player is always reported to be alive.

Here, we are going to rewrite the code of this function to actually check if the player should be dead. We will do this by looping over all the enemies, and checking if their box overlaps the player box.

If at least one enemy overlaps the player, then your function should return `true`. Otherwise it should return `false.

A good strategy would be to console.log both this.player and this.enemies. When you look in the console, you will see that those two objects contain the information necessary to detect a collision.

As a hint, note that the box of each enemy is defined by its `x` and `y` coordinates and the `ENEMY_WIDTH` and `ENEMY_HEIGHT` constants. There are similar variables for the player.

### 2. Let's do some refactoring!

Look at the `Player` and `Enemy` classes and notice that their `render` methods are identical. This violates our sacred DRY principle. Let's fix it!

While there are many ways to fix it, here we will do it by creating a superclass called `Entity`. This superclass will not need a constructor, and will only have the `render` method.

Then, we'll make `Player` and `Enemy` extend the `Entity` class, and remove the `render` methods from both classes.

Having done this manipulation will break our constructors. Make sure to fix it by calling the appropriate function from your constructors.

### 3. Flavor it!

### The sky is not the limit!!

Having completed the basic section of this project is already great! However, this should leave you plenty of time for the fun part: customizing and evolving the game. Since this is an open-ended activity, we will give you some suggestions. Feel free to use them or not.

- Instead of completely stopping the game when it's over, allow the player to start a new game
- Add a sound track and sound effects to the game
- Add the possibility of having lives
- Increase the difficulty level of the game as time passes by making the enemies go faster
- Allow the enemies and player to have animated sprites instead of the current static ones. You could do this by defining a sprite as an array of images and setting a speed at which these images should switch. This could be implemented in the `render` method.
- Allow the player to shoot bullets at the Nyan Cats
- Add another type of entity called `Bonus` that will also fall from the sky and add points to the score
- Make the game more hardcore by allowing the player to also move up/down and making Nyan Cats also shoot from the left of the screen
- **Don't stop!** These suggestions are only here to get you started :)

## Project Success guidelines

In order for the project to be deemed _successful_ and for you to receive a passing grade

- you need to complete steps 1 and 2 completely.
- add at least 4 _improvements_ to the game.

### Submission

- Be sure to add a screenshot to the PR.
- Provide a link to the game in your project portfolio on surge.sh (If you need help setting this up, see someone).
